# Slapdash Endeavours

As the name suggests, this is a place I keep random projects that don't fit anywhere else.

Each project is something that was usually done intensely for a short period of time - one evening, ne weekend, etc.

Pretty much everything is done within a Jupyter notebook (ending `.ipynb`) for each project, so opening one of those is the best thing to do (ignore the other files).
